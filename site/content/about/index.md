# Who am I?

I am **Jordan Isaacs**: an undergraduate studying Economics (focusing in Digital Economy) and Computer Science at Carnegie Mellon University. I love solving problems that I encounter in my daily life with technology, and then sharing them with the world.

I also am an avid skier and am passionate about the outdoors which will inevitably make an appearance on my blog.
