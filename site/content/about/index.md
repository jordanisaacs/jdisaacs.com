# Who am I?

I am **Jordan Isaacs**: a senior undergraduate studying Economics (focusing in Digital Economy) at Carnegie Mellon University. I love solving problems that I encounter in my daily life with technology, and then sharing them with the world.

I also am an avid skier and am passionate about the outdoors which will inevitably make an appearance on my blog.

I am shamelessly looking for a full time software engineering role upon my graduation in Spring 2023 so feel free to reach out :)
